# SPI Communication using the PIC18F4520 and External EEPROM

A simple SPI project that implements a simple communication between the PIC18F4520 and the 25AA640 (EEPROM).

The project consists of storing data into the EEPROM and reading it back using the SPI module. More specifically, you are going to store the value 0x07 in address 0x12 of the EEPROM and then read it back.
